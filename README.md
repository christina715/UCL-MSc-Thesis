This repository includes the source codes required for Msc thesis project about a link rewiring algorithm which is based on second-order assortative mixing.

## Project description

The second-order assortative mixing presents strong in social networks which have the behavior of first-order assortative mixing, while it is weak in non-social networks which do not perform assortative mixing. Therefore, there is a doubt whether the second-order assortative mixing is independent of first-order mixing pattern.

A link rewiring algorithm is designed to address this problem. By preserving degree distribution, first-order mixing pattern, and rich-club connectivity of the network, three link rewiring patterns i.e., second-order assortative reconnecting, second-order disassortative reconnecting and random reconnecting, are derived to explore the range of second-order mixing pattern.

The results under the research exhibit the second-order assortative is not constraint by either first-order degree correlation or rich-club structure. These outcomes further support the idea of second-order assortative mixing as a fresh characteristic of networks.
